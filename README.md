## Hi there 👋

I’m JunWoo Park, currently an undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University.
My research sits at the intersection of **Healthcare & AI**, where I aim to develop intelligent solutions that improve diagnostic accuracy, personalize treatment plans, and accelerate drug discovery.

### 🔬 Research Highlights
- **MoltiTox: Multi-Modal Toxicity Prediction (AI-Healthcare Lab)** 
  – Designed a fusion framework combining graph, SMILES, 2D-image, and NMR modalities.  
  – Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Tox21 dataset with an attention-based fusion of four encoders.
